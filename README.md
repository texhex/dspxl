# Dyson Sphere Program Excel

Dyson Sphere Program Excel is a small helper for planning your next factory in Microsoft Excel. It contains most of the component recipes and can tell you how many inputs you require and what you will get as output.

TL;DR: [Direct download link](https://github.com/texhex/dspxl/raw/main/DSPXL_v0.6.xlsx).

It is intened to be used until someone creates a fancy pants website that will do these calculations better. Therefore, this file has several limitations.

## Limitations

* Calculations are based on Assembler MK.II only (Production Speed 1x).
* Not all recipes, especially buildings, are included.
* There are most likely bugs I’m not aware off
